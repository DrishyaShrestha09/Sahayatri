# Sahayatri - Crowdfunding Web Application

To simplify this process and bring it online, I created a platform where campaigns can be created and donations can be collected more efficiently.

## 📌 Note

This project was purely built out of my personal interest to address a real-life issue I personally witnessed in my community, where people struggled to raise funds for their loved ones. It’s my small step towards making that process easier, more accessible, and to help minimize fraud by providing a verified, transparent platform for fundraising.
